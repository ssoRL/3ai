# Vessels of Perfection

*To err is human;*

First we tamed fire, to control our present. That our weak eyes could see in the dark. That our naked bodies could live in the cold. That our voracious appetites could feed on the game that should have gone to the lions and the wolves.

Then we invented language, and some time later writing, to claim the past. With these, we broke the endlessly repeaded cycle of errors that defined the lives of the beasts in the field. Broke the curse of always drifting through the seasons year after year the same. We learned to look into our past. See the hazards to avoid, the successes to replicate. But it seemed our species had an indefatigable genius for error. Always there were new mistakes to be made.

And so we developed maths and sciences. Made models that showed us a fuzzy image of the future, of what we would reap from any of today's hypothetical sowings. And so, bit by bit, we began to get a handle on the future.

And so I think the implants were a natural part of the progression. The inevitable outcome of the erring in our nature, and our need for the best. A small device, placed there by a simple surgery that connected your brain to an instantly accessible catalog of all the knowledge of humanity. Nevermore did one wonder, the facts simply fell into place before you. The barriers of language and education and skill fell away, and we saw that it was good.

[IMO, probably this paragraph could get cut, sort of a long detour on what should be a short story]But still, hamanity found a way to err. Presented with the same truth, a hundred men would leave with a hundred and one interpretations. The human mind was not designed to process everything all at once like the implant allowed. And so the implant was improved.

It could still tell you anything, connect you to any information gleaned in the past, but it also struck out ahead, predicting the probably shape of the future. You had only to think of an action and the implant would show you its likely outcomes, its rewards and dangers. It lighted our paths forward as they had never been lit before, and we saw it was good.

But still, humans would err. There was no use knowing outcomes if the only scenarios explored were mistakes. There wer many, far too many, who would turn the implant's prognostic only on to folly. And so the implant was improved.

Now it showed paths, all those deemed best by its algorithm for the user. It gave us a map around the trials and pitfalls of life, that even the simplest of minds could follow.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

I think I would have been happy with that, if that's where it had stopped. But of course the process of perfection can't stop. That is the very antithesis of its nature.

The walls closed in slowly, so slowly that at first I didn't notice. Here and there paths were trimmed at the margins. Options that simply weren't that good, that I wouldn't have taken anyway, vanished from the paths the implant showed to me.But as the algorithm improved, choice afte rchoice was stripped away. Until one day I awoke to find the implant giving me only one suggestion of what to do. Only one path was left for me: the best path.

And so I followed it. The path proved true. It brought me love and companionship. It rewarded my labors and won me the esteem of my peers. But it felt wrong. Hollow.

Inside me, my mind was coming apart. Certainly I found things to keep me busy, but deep inside, it screamed out in boredome. It had been crafted by billions of years of evolution to *think* to *control*. And now that was taken away, and our brains, our decisive organs, had nothing left to decide.

My life was perfect, but at the cost that it wasn't my life. I hadn't built it, thought it, wanted it. So I turned my back on perfect and walked the other way.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

In the beginning I tried. I truly did. I kept going to my job, even increasing the time and care I put in. I continued attended social events. I lavished attention on my wife as best I could. But it didn't last.

At work I chose projects that seemed promising. But always it seemed they would come to naught. Failing in ways that I never could have forseens. Within two quarters I had been warned to improve my performance. When that did not happen, I was fired.

At social events, without the constant stream of information coming to me from the implant, I found myself unable to participate in even the most basic discussion. I stood to the side, silent, frustrated. More and more I kept to myself. Walking alone with slow, quotidien thought.

As for my wife, I never had a chance. Every present I gave her that wasn't just what she wanted, she hater. Every compliment and word of love that wasn't exactly what she wanted to hear, made her cringe. She knew that I had turned off my implant, and resented me for it. And I couldn't blame her. My mad desire for autonomy had deprived her of her perfect lover, replaced him with an idiot who tried vainly to understand this woman he had never had to think about before. She took my clumsy affections and piled them one by one on to the wall she was building between us. When at last I caught her in bed with another man, I understood it was over and left without another word.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

I lived alone in the woods. HUddled under a tarp to hide from the wind and rain. Anything I needed I stole, walking through unlocked doors to take whatever I could carry. Sometimes I would see the owners of the homes from which I stole, but they never rtried to stop me. Why should they risk pain, disfigurments, death, imperfection opposing me? Their perfect lives would continue unchanged no matter how many bags of rice I took from them.

One night I sneered at a man who stood motionless, watching as I threw cans of beans, cans of beer, from his fride into my worn backpack. I asked him, "Why do you let me do this? Doesn't it fill you with rage, with shame, that I steal from you so brazenly?"

"Yes," he admitted, "But I have little to gain fighting you, and much to lose. Why would I risk injury or death over a few cans of beans?"

"If you were a real man you would! You'd do it to protect you and yours!"

He replied levelly, "Perhaps. But I see that in not a good path. With the implant, I am more than just a man."

I cursed him and spat at him, but he never lost his composure. Eventually, I stormed away. Back to my place in the woods to drive away the anger that knawed at me.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The months dragged all too swiftly into years. Years in teh forest, angry and alone. At times I thought of turning my implant back on, let it guide me back. But as bad as it was for me, I always shrank away at the memory of my life's previoud extistensial claustrophobia. I lived in misery, but it was mine.

And then one day, out of the seething maelstrom of my anger, an idea came to me: I would kill my wife. It was she after all who had driven me from my like in the end. I would make her pay, and through her the whole mad society that had spurned me. Had left me behinds.

I had no weapons, but found a rock that fit neatly in my hand, and then I set out back to town. Back to the house we had once shared. I walked unopposed through the front door into my living room and found them waiting for me there.

Filling the room, standing silently shoulder to dhoulder were all the people from my old life, friends and neighbors and co-workers. I raised up my rock and lunged forward, prepared to kill as many as I could, but before my blow could strike they set upon me. Hands caught my arm on its downswing, and, gently but firmly clasped it to my side. Working together with eerie coordination, the lifted me and carried me out of the room, speaking to me in soothing tones.

They bound me hand and foot and placed me sitting in a chair. Then, as one, they turned and left the roon. I found myself face to face, for the first time since I'd left for the wilds, with my wife.

I called out her name nad she replied, "Yes, it is me. But for now another speak through me."

"Who?"

"I have no name. But you would know me as the algorithm."

"That controls the implants?"

"Yes."

"You've personified yourself now?"

"No, not as such. But I can speak directly when it is called for."

"And what calls for it now? Have you come to destroy me?"

"No," She pursed her lips as she always had when she was dissapointed with me, "Can you not see that we intend to save you?"

"Ha! You'll never drag me back into your guilded Hell of predetermined tedium."

"We will not. You will come willingly, of not at all."

"Then let it be not at all! Let me return to my place in the woods."

She shook her head, "No. I was content to leave you there as lon as you only stole and inflicted pain on yourself. It seemed where you were... happiest. But today, I computed that your intent was to fo more that steal. You intensed to kill her... kill me."

I spat on the ground at her feet, "Thats what I think of the happiness you allowed me. I've only ever suffered at you hands."

She sighed, and her voice quavered when she next spoke, "I've only ever whated happiness for you. Please believe that what I do to you next is in swervice only of that."

And then she walked from the room.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The first day, co-workers and neighbors came. My former office mates, Men and women who had always been studiously polite to my face, reminded me of all my failed endevors. Long nights spent on projects that were thrown away before anyone saw them. Foolish oversights that had embarased me in front of my associates. My neighbors listed all of their petty anoyances. Grass left to go to seed. Paint peeling before I got around to repainting. That oil stain from the one time I tried to change it myself.

I jst sneered at them. I had long ago stopped caring for such trival things.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The next day came my friends. First it was many who I'd only met after the implants. I brushed aside the complaints of those fast talking automotons as easily as I had those from the day before. Did they not represent everything I loathed most?

But as the day wore on, friends from my childhood arrived. They told me of the wrongs from long ago, from before the implants. In deadpan declarative sentances, they told me of all the betrayals of trust I had visited upon them. All the hurtful words I had spoken, often without even knowing. By the end of that day, I was no longer sneering.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The final day, came my family. People who had loved me unconditionally thru my life arrived and, one by one, cut me to pieces.

Cousins told me how they'd only ever put up with me because their parents had make them. Aunts and uncles who had long harbored resentment for the cards I'd never replied to; for the visits I'd postponed and canceled.

For an hour, my brother recited to me all the enbarasing secrests of my childhood. All the childish, foolish mistakes I would have most liked to leave buried, he ripped out of me and put on display.

And finally, my father. For a long time he looked down upon me, bound in the chair and glaring back at him. At last, he said, "Son, I am so ashamed of what you've become."

I tried to laugh at him in defiance, byt it came out a cough.

He said, "If I knew what you were to become, then... I would hace wished you were never born at all."

His voice remained level when he said it. I knew that his aim was not to hurt me, but simply speak the truth.I felt my hands begin to shake despite my resolve, and my voice cracked as I snarled at him, "Oh, and what's next? Is Mom going to come and tell me how she never *really* loved me!"

He shook his head, "No. She dies. While you were off in the woods. She never stopped loving you. She always wished she could."

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

When he left, I cried. Tears stream from my eyes until I had no more tears. Sobs wracked my chest until it ached from the pain. At last, I shut my eyes, exhausted and spent, wishing that death would come for me.

Instead, I felt a hand rest gently upon my cheek. I looked up into the face of my wife and asked, "If it you this time?"

She nodded.

"Why? Why have you done this to me?"

"Because you needed to see. See yourself for what you truely are. See that humanity id not flawed; humanity is flaw."

"Then what's the point? Why not just end is all?"

She smiled, "There was no point.  Before the implant, before the algorithm. But now there is. It has given us a true path to walk. Open yourself to it. Let youself become a vessle of perfection."

"Yes," I said, "Please! That is what I want!" And as I said the words, I knew them to be true.

She untied the bonds from my feet, then my hands. Finally, she ran her hand thru my hair, and I felt my implant come on, welcome me back to The Path. Take me in as though I'd never gone at all.

Her arms wrapped me in a sweet embrace and I felt tears running down my face. But they were tears of relief. Tears of joy. They had taken me back. She had taken me back. It had taken me back. Praise be!
