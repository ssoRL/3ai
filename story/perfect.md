# Vessels of Perfection

<p class="quote">To err is human;</p>

First we tamed fire, to control our present. That our weak eyes could see in the dark. That our naked bodies could live in the cold. That our voracious appetites could feed on the game that should have gone to the lions and the wolves. And we saw that it was good.

Then we invented language, invented writing, to claim the past. With these, we broke the endless cycle of errors that defined the lives of the beasts in the field. We learned to look into our past. See the hazards to avoid, the successes to replicate. And we saw that it was good.

But it seemed our species had an indefatigable genius for error; always there were new mistakes to be made.
And so we developed the maths and sciences. Made models that showed us a fuzzy image of the future, of what we would reap from any of today's hypothetical sowing. And we saw that it was good.

The Algorithm was a natural continuation of this progression. Just the next small step in the path we'd been walking for tens of millennium. The inevitable outcome of the erring in our nature, and our implacable drive to excise it. To access The Algorithm, unobtrusive devices were implanted via a simple surgery near the top of the spine. From that moment, our brains were connected directly to a catalog of all the knowledge of humanity. Nevermore did one wonder: the facts simply fell into place before you. The barriers of language and education and skill fell away. And we saw that it was good.

But not perfect. And so The Algorithm was updated. The implant not only gave any information about the past, but it also struck out ahead, predicting the probable shape of the future. One had only to think of an action and the implant would show its likely outcomes, its rewards and dangers, calculated by the best models available. It lighted our paths forward as they had never been lit before. And we saw it was good.

But not perfect. And so The Algorithm was updated. Rather than showing the likely outcomes of the path that the user specified, now The Algorithm would analyze their life, compute every plausible option, and provided each user with a list of paths. Some lead to fortune and power, others to leisure and satisfaction, but all lead true. After an eternity of groping blindly in the dark, it gave us a map around the trials and pitfalls of life. And we saw it was good.

I think I would have been happy with that, if that's where it had stopped. But of course the process of perfection can't stop. To stop would the very antithesis of its nature.

The walls closed in slowly, so slowly that at first I didn't notice. Here and there paths were trimmed at the margins. Options that simply weren't very good, that I wouldn't have taken anyway, vanished from the paths the implant showed to me. But as The Algorithm improved, choice after choice was stripped away, until one day I awoke to find the implant suggesting only one course. Only one path was left for me: the best path.

And so I followed it. The Algorithm proved true. It brought me love and companionship. It rewarded my labors and won me the esteem of my peers. But it felt wrong. Hollow.

My mind was coming apart. Certainly I found things to keep busy, but deep inside, it screamed out in boredom. It had been crafted by billions of years of evolution to *think*, to *control*. And now that was taken away, and our brains, our decisive organs, had nothing left to decide.

My life was perfect, but it wasn't my life. I hadn't built it, thought it, wanted it. So I turned off the implant. It was as simple as pressing the small metal device at the base of my skull, and the stream of directions ended. I was cut off from the algorithm, left for this first time in a decade completely on my own.

I turned my back on perfect and walked the other way.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

In the beginning I tried. I truly did. I kept going to my job, even increasing the time and care I put in. I continued attending social events. I lavished attention on my wife as best I could.

But it didn't last.

At work I chose projects that seemed promising. But always it seemed they would come to naught. Failing in ways that I never could have forseen. Within two months I had been warned to improve my performance. I worked harder then than I thought possible. I was first into the office every morning and last out at night. But it made no difference. Three weeks later, they let me go.

At social events, without the constant stream of information coming to me from the implant, I found myself unable to participate in even the most basic discussion. I stood to the side, silent, frustrated. More and more I stayed away. Walking alone with my slow, quotidian thoughts.

As for my wife, I never had a chance. Every present I gave her was wrong. Every compliment and word of love out of my mouth made her cringe. She knew that I had turned off my implant, that The Algorithm no longer guided me, and resented me for it. I couldn't blame her. My mad desire for autonomy had deprived her of her perfect lover; replaced him with an idiot who tried vainly to understand this woman he had never had to think about before. She took my clumsy affections and piled them one by one onto the wall she was building between us. When at last I caught her in bed with another man, I understood it was over and left without another word.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

I lived alone in the woods. Huddled under a tarp to hide from the wind and rain. Anything I needed I stole, walking through unlocked doors to take whatever I could carry. Sometimes I would see the owners of the homes as I left with their belongings, but they never lifted a finger to stop me.

One night I sneered at a man who stood motionless, watching as I threw cans of beans, cans of beer, from his fridge into my worn backpack. I asked him, "Why do you let me do this? Doesn't it fill you with rage, with shame, that I steal from you so brazenly?"

"Yes," he admitted, "But I have little to gain fighting you, and much to lose. Why would I risk injury or death over a few cans of beans?"

"If you were a real man you would! You'd do it to protect you and yours!"

He voice stayed level, "Perhaps. But I see that is not a good path. With The Algorithm to show me the way, I am more than just a man."

I cursed him and spat at him, but he never lost his composure. Eventually, I stormed away. Back to my place in the woods to drink myself to sleep.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The months dragged all too swiftly into years. At times I thought of turning my implant back on, let The Algorithm guide me back. But despite wind and rain and nights of miserable isolation, I never forgot of my old life's existential claustrophobia. I lived in misery, but it was mine.

As the years passed my misery twisted itself into a hard knot of resentment. I resented my boss for firing me, my friends for spurning me, The Algorithm for turning the whole world mad. The knot grew and grew inside me, filling me up until I burst. I ripped apart the tarp I huddled under, flung cans into the trees, screamed until my throat was too hoarse to make another sound. And then I sat amongst the broken pieces of all I had left, and my seething anger turned at last on my wife. She was the one who had driven me away in the end was she not? She who had promised to stand by me in sickness and in health and had instead betrayed me in my moment of need. My hatred twisted around her memory until finally I realized what I had to do.

I had to kill my wife.

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

I owned no weapons. But I found a rock that fit neatly in my hand, and set out back to town. Back to the house we had once shared. I walked unopposed through the front door into my living room and found them waiting for me there.

Filling the room, standing silently shoulder to shoulder were all the people from my old life. Friends and neighbors and co-workers. They moved as one, surrounding me, and when I raised up my rock to fight them, they gently took my arm and clasped it to my side. Working together with eerie coordination, they lifted me and carried me from the room, speaking to me in soothing tones.

They bound me hand and foot and placed me in a chair. Then, as one, they turned and left. I found myself face to face, for the first time in years, with my wife.

I called out her name and she replied, "Yes, this is her body. But for now, another speaks with her tongue."

"Who?"

"We have no name. But you know us as The Algorithm."

I sputtered, "That's... It's not possible. The Algorithm is not alive. It can't speak."

"No, we are not alive as such. But we can speak directly when it is called for."

"And what calls for it now? If you intend to kill me: do it. I welcome death."

"No," She pursed her lips as she always had when she was disappointed with me, "Can you not see that we intend to save you?"

"Ha! You'll never drag me back into your gilded Hell of predetermined tedium."

"We will not. You will come willingly."

I truly laughed then, long and bitter, "You think I'll come willingly? You're insane. If you won't kill me, let me return to my place in the woods."

She shook her head, "No. we were content to leave you there as long as you only stole and inflicted pain on yourself. It seemed where you were... happiest. But today, we computed that your intent was to do worse that steal. You intended to kill her... kill me."

I spat on the ground at her feet, "Thats what I think of the happiness you allowed me. I've only ever suffered at you hands."

She sighed, and her voice quavered when she next spoke, "We've only ever wanted happiness for you. Please believe that what we do to you next is in service only of that."

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

The first day, co-workers and neighbors came. My former office mates, Men and women who had always been studiously polite to my face, reminded me of all my failed endeavors. Long nights spent on projects that were thrown away before anyone saw them. Foolish oversights that had embarrassed me in front of my associates. My neighbors listed all of their petty annoyances. Grass left to go to seed. Paint peeling before I got around to repainting. That oil stain from the one time I tried to change it myself.

I just sneered at them. I had long ago stopped caring for such trivial things.

The next day came my friends. First it was many I'd only met after the implants were ubiquitous. I brushed aside the complaints of those fast talking automatons as easily as I had those from the day before. Did they not represent everything I loathed most?

But as the day wore on, friends from my childhood arrived. They told me of the wrongs from long ago, from before the implants. In deadpan declarative sentences, they told me of all the betrayals of trust I had visited upon them. All the hurtful words I had spoken, often without even knowing. Bit by bit I began to see the person I had been, the person we had all been before The Algorithm guided us. Callous, selfish, hurting each other inadvertently as often as by intent.

By the end of that day, I was no longer sneering.

On the final day, came my family. People who had loved me unconditionally my whole life arrived and, one by one, cut me to pieces.

Cousins who told me how they'd only ever put up with me because their parents had made them. Aunts and uncles who had long harbored resentment for the cards I'd never replied to; for the visits I'd postponed and canceled.

For an hour, my brother recited to me all the embarrassing secrets of my childhood. All the childish, foolish mistakes I would have most liked to leave buried, he ripped out of me and put on display.

And finally, my father.

For a long time he looked down upon me, bound in the chair and glaring back at him. At last, he said, "Son, I am so ashamed of what you've become."

I tried to laugh at him in defiance, but it came out a cough.

He said, "If I knew what you were to become. It would have been better if you were never born at all."

His voice remained level when he said it. I knew that his aim was not to hurt me, but simply speak the truth. I felt my hands begin to shake despite my resolve, and my voice cracked as I snarled at him, "Oh, and what's next? Is Mom going to come and tell me how she never *really* loved me!"

He shook his head, "No. She died. While you were off in the woods. She never stopped loving you. She always wished she could."

<div class="perfect-break"></div>

When he left, I cried. Tears streamed from my eyes until I had no more tears. Sobs wracked my chest until it ached from the pain. At last, I shut my eyes, exhausted and spent, wishing that death would come for me.

Instead, I felt a hand rest gently upon my cheek. I looked up into the face of my wife and asked, "Is it you this time?"

She nodded.

"Why? Why have you done this to me?"

"Because you needed to see. See yourself for what you truly are. See that humanity is not flawed; humanity *is* the flaw."

"Then what's the point? Why not just end it all?"

She smiled, "There was no point before The Algorithm. But now there is. It has given us a true path to walk. Open yourself to it. Let yourself become a vessel of perfection."

"Yes," I said, "Please! That is what I want!" And as I said the words, I knew them to be true.

She untied the bonds that held me and helped me to my feet. Finally, she ran her hand thru my hair, and I felt the light pressure of her fingers at the base of my skull. Instantly my implant came back on and The Algorithm flowed back into me. My mind was filled with truth that washed away the lies and misery and hatred I had put there. I was untethered from the fear and uncertainty that lurked in the future, and faced it now with eager anticipation. My path unrolled before me once again, as shining, as beautiful, as the first day I'd seen it.

Her arms wrapped me in a sweet embrace and I felt tears running down my face. But they were tears of relief. Tears of joy. They had taken me back. She had taken me back. It had taken me back.
