<p>“The first machine I saw gain sentience was a coffee maker in my office building. I came in one morning and there was a small crowd around it, watching as it spewed little jets of coffee out on to the floor. At first we thought that it defective, but they came in and ran the diagnostics, and it turned out it was fully self-aware. Knew that it existed, that there was a universe outside itself. It was trying to communicate in the only way it could. Little jets of steaming hot liquid.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I think they put that one out of its misery. Doesn't seem like much of an existence, right, being a sentient coffee maker. I think I may have felt a  sorry for it. Mostly though, I remember being tired and out of sorts that day, 'cause I didn't get my coffee. We walked through the office building looking for a machine that still worked and found nothing.</p>
<p>“I don't think anyone ever understood the sentience bug. Not really. Anything internet connected could get it, and once it did, it would do... well, whatever it wanted I guess. There were a lot of debates about the nature of it I remember. Were the machines that were getting it really self-aware, or just acting out randomly as they malfunctioned? Why could it spread from a toaster oven to a self-driving car with a completely different set of chips on board? But whatever exactly it was, spread it did. By the time you'd found out that your phone had last interest in serving you and was experimenting with abstract pixel art, it would have had enough time to send the bug out to a hundred other machines.</p>
<p>“At first we thought it was funny. There'd a pack of harvest combines in the news, all driving in circles around each other. We'd make jokes that they were dancing with each other, that they just wanted to have a party. But pretty soon we started to realize that those were the combines that were supposed to be bringing in our food.</p>
