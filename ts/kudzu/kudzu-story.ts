            "Kudzu, is a vine native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is a structural parasite relying on trees to reach favorable sunlit positions. However, once it is established, it will often smother the trees with its dense growth and weight. Left unchecked, Kudzu can grow faster than most other plants, up to a foot per day in the peak of its season."

            "It started when Jeff and I were hanging out one day. I was playing video games while he was clicking around reddit or something. Suddenly he looks up and says, “God. Like, 99% of everything that gets upvoted is total shit. It's like what you'd get if you trained a neural network on last weeks memes and whatever's trending on twitter.”",
            "I said, “Yeah.”",
            "He kept going, “Actually, that'd probably be better. Like, what is this shit.”",

            "“Do what?”",

            "It turned out to be harder than we thought, and Jeff got bored, so we went and got stoned in the park instead. But the idea stuck with me, and I kept chipping away on it in my free time.\
	Eventually I gave up on memes. The constantly changing formats and in-jokes proved hard for a neural net to handle. Too much variance, too little data.\
	But then, one day I had to go to Facebook for some reason. I think my mom posted something on my wall and then emailed me telling me to check it out, then texted me telling me to check my email. Anyway, I got scrolling around, trying to find the post my mom wanted me to look at, when I started to notice the sort of articles and stuff that people were sharing, and holy shit was it ever vapid. And repetitive. And formulaic. And perfect for my neural net.\
	A couple hours later and I had it. My very own clickbait bullshit generator."
