            "Kudzu, is a vine native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is a structural parasite relying on trees to reach favorable sunlit positions. However, once it is established, it will often smother the trees with its dense growth and weight. Left unchecked, Kudzu can grow faster than most other plants, up to a foot per day in the peak of its season."
